# SwErlDemos
A repository with multiple demonstration apps

1. OTPsmallDemo/DocSim - a simulation of a small loading dock and packaging facility using GenServers, GenStateMs, and EventManagers.
2. processesSmallDemo/SwErlDemo - a simple, displayed counter that increments each time a button is clicked using  stateless and stateful asynchronous SwErlProcesses.
